    This runs Postfix (as a relay) in Docker.

    - ⚠️ Postfix acts as an open relay. As such, this is not meant to be run on the internet, only on a trusted internal network! ⚠️
    - You must already have a account on an external SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, AWS SES, etc...).
    - Your external SMTP server must be using encryption (i.e., plaintext is not allowed)

I'm using this project to help me learn [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) but also because I could never settle on a server management software that I enjoyed to use.
