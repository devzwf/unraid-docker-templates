  <Overview>A Docker Container To Sync Two Piholes.&#xD;
&#xD;
This is the Receiver/Secondary, you will need a Sender/Master on the host who is running the Sender/Master Pi-Hole.&#xD;
&#xD;
NOTE: The sending and recieving container are only necessary for solving permissions issues without giving root access to the recieving container. If you have no problem giving root access to the recieving end (at the cost of security), or your recieving Pihole is not running in Docker, you don't need to use the recieving container.&#xD;

  <Config Name="Node Type" Target="NODE" Default="receiver" Mode="" Description="This is where you should define if the container is the sender or the receiver" Type="Variable" Display="advanced-hide" Required="true" Mask="false">receiver</Config>
  <Config Name="SSH Port" Target="22" Default="22222" Mode="tcp" Description="This is the port you want to expose for rsync/ssh. Your host is likely using 22 for SSH already, so it should be a non-standard port. The default of 22222 is probably fine. However, if you change this on the receiver node, be sure to change the REM_SSH_PORT on the sender node." Type="Port" Display="always" Required="true" Mask="false">22222</Config>
  <Config Name="Root directory" Target="/root" Default="" Mode="rw" Description="This is the directory in which the SSH key file and the known hosts file will be stored, so it needs to be persistent." Type="Path" Display="always" Required="true" Mask="false"/>
